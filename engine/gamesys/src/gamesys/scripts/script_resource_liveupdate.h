     * manifest. Before storing a manifest that has been downloaded it is
     * important to verify that the manifest was created using the correct
     * private key during the bundle process, this is done by passing the
     * reference returned by `create_manifest` to the function `verify_manifest`.
     *
     * Once the manifest has been verified, this reference should be passed on
     * to the functions `verify_resource` and `store_manifest` when updating a game.
     * It is possible to create up to eight different manifests at the same
     * time and it is important that the manifests are removed by passing the
     * reference to `destroy_manifest` once all processing has been done to free
     * up memory.
