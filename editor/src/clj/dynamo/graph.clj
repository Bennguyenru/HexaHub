(defn construct
  "Creates an instance of a node. The node type must have been
  previously defined via `defnode`.

  The node's properties will all have their default values. The caller
  may pass key/value pairs to override properties.

  A node that has been constructed is not connected to anything and it
  doesn't exist in any graph yet.

  Example:
  (defnode GravityModifier
    (property acceleration Int (default 32))

  (construct GravityModifier :acceleration 16)"
  [node-type-ref & {:as args}]
  (in/construct node-type-ref args))

(defn- var-it [it] (list `var it))

(defmacro defnode
  "Given a name and a specification of behaviors, creates a node,
   and attendant functions.

  Allowed clauses are:

  (inherits _symbol_)

  Compose the behavior from the named node type

  (input _symbol_ _schema_ [:array]?)

  Define an input with the name, whose values must match the schema.

  If the :array flag is present, then this input can have multiple
  outputs connected to it. Without the :array flag, this input can
  only have one incoming connection from an output.

  (property _symbol_ _property-type_ & _options_)

  Define a property with schema and, possibly, default value and
  constraints. Property options include the following:
    (default _value_)
    Set a default value for the property. If no default is set, then the property will be nil.

    (value _getter_)
    Define a custom getter. It must be an fnk. The fnk's arguments are magically wired the same as an output producer.

    (dynamic _label_ _evaluator_)
    Define a dynamic attribute of the property. The label is a symbol. The evaluator is an fnk like the getter.

    (set (fn [evaluation-context self old-value new-value]))
    Define a custom setter. This is _not_ an fnk, but a strict function of 4 arguments.

  (output _symbol_ _type_ (:cached)? _producer_)

  Define an output to produce values of type. The ':cached' flag is
  optional. _producer_ may be a var that names an fn, or fnk.  It may
  also be a function tail as [arglist] + forms.

  Values produced on an output with the :cached flag will be cached in
  memory until the node is affected by some change in inputs or
  properties. At that time, the cached value will be sent for
  disposal.

  Example (from [[editors.atlas]]):

    (defnode TextureCompiler
      (input    textureset TextureSet)
      (property texture-filename Str (default \"\"))
      (output   texturec Any compile-texturec)))

    (defnode TextureSetCompiler
      (input    textureset TextureSet)
      (property textureset-filename Str (default \"\"))
      (output   texturesetc Any compile-texturesetc)))

    (defnode AtlasCompiler
      (inherit TextureCompiler)
      (inherit TextureSetCompiler))

  This will produce a record `AtlasCompiler`. `defnode` merges the
  behaviors appropriately.

    A node may also implement protocols or interfaces, using a syntax
  identical to `deftype` or `defrecord`. A node may implement any
  number of such protocols.

  Every node always implements dynamo.graph/Node."

   The `:traverse?` predicate determines whether the target node will be
  included at all. If it returns a falsey value, then traversal stops
  there. That node and all arcs to it will be left behind. If the
  predicate returns true, then that node --- or a stand-in for it ---
  will be included in the fragment.

  `:traverse?` will be called with the basis and arc data.

   The `:serializer` function determines _how_ to represent the node
  in the fragment.  `dynamo.graph/default-node-serializer` adds a map
  with the original node's properties and node type. `paste` knows how
  to turn that map into a new (copied) node.

   You would use a `:serializer` function if you wanted to record a
  memo that could later be used to resolve and connect to an existing
  node rather than copy it.

  `:serializer` will be called with the node value. It must return an
   associative data structure (e.g., a map or a record).

   Note that connections to or from any nodes along the override chain
  will be flattened to source or target the serialized node instead of
  the nodes that it overrides.
