        "Contains functions for loading and saving files. This includes the definitions
for loaders by file type (extension).

Two record types are defined, `ProjectPath` and `NativePath`.

*ProjectPath*: represents a project-relative path to a resource. The [[project-path]] function
creates and returns a ProjectPath. Implements [[PathManipulation]] and [[ProjectRelative]].

*NativePath*: represents a path, typically to a resource, as represented in
the native file system. Overrides `.toString()`. Implements [[PathManipulation]].

A project path can be converted into a native path, but the reverse is not true.

Both `ProjectPath` and `NativePath` satisfy the `clojure.java.io/IOFactory` protocol,
and have the corresponding `make-reader`, `make-writer`, `make-input-stream` and
`make-output-stream` functions."

        #'write-native-file
        "Given a NativePath and contents, writes the contents to the build path"

        #'new-builder
        "Dynamically construct a protocol buffer builder, given a class as a variable."

        #'project-path
        "given a project-state, returns a ProjectPath containing the path to the project's files."

        #'write-project-file
        "Write the given contents into the file at path."

        #'in-build-directory
        "given a ProjectPath, translates that path into a NativePath containing the
         corresponding build location"

        #'eclipse-path
        "Returns the path relative to a project container."

        #'eclipse-file
        "Returns the file relative to a project container."

        #'extension
        "Returns the extension represented by this path."

        #'replace-extension
        "Returns a new path with the desired extension."

        #'local-path
        "Returns a string representation of the path and extension."

        #'alter-path
        "Apply the function to the path part, without altering the extension, maybe with a collection of extra args."

        #'protocol-buffer-loader
          "Create a new loader that knows how to read protocol buffer files in text format.

class is the Java class generated by the protoc compiler. It will probably be an inner class
of some top-level name. Instead of a '.' for the inner class name separator, use a '$'.

For example, the inner class called AtlasProto.Atlas in Java becomes AtlasProto$Atlas.

f is a function to call with the deserialised protocol buffer message. f must take two arguments, the
resource name and the immutable protocol buffer itself."

        #'message->node
          "This is an extensible function that you implement to help load a specific file
type. Most of the time, these will be created for you by the
dynamo.file.protobuf/protocol-buffer-converter macro.

Create an implementation by adding something like this to your namespace:

    (defmethod message->node message-classname
      [message-instance container container-target desired-output & {:as overrides}]
      (,,,) ;; implementation
    )

You'll replace _message-classname_ with the Java class that matches the message
type to convert. The _message-instance_ argument will contain an instance of the
class specified in _message-classname_.

If the message instance contains other messages (as in the case of protocol buffers,
for example) then you should call message->node recursively with the same resource-name
and the child message.

When container is set, it means this node should be connected to the container. In that case,
container-target is the label to connect _to_ and desired-output is the label to connect
from. It is an error for a container to ask for a desired-output that doesn't exist on the
node being created by this function.

Overrides is a map of additional properties to set on the new node.

Given a resource name and message describing the resource,
create (and return?) a list of nodes."
