Label should be a human-readable string. It will appear

If you use the same category-id and command-id more than once,

In the first form, the handler will always be enabled. Upon invocation, it
will call the function bound to fn-var with the
org.eclipse.core.commands.ExecutionEvent and the additional args.

In the second form, enablement-fn will be checked. When it returns a truthy
value, the handler will be enabled. Enablement-fn must have metadata to
identify the evaluation context variables and properties that affect its
return value."}]
