* "Geometry Wars" - iOS, Android, desktops
* Defold Facebook test app - iOs, Android
* BBS - iOS, Android, desktops
* Presto - iOS, Android

Here is a [Jenkins link](https://jenkins-stockholm.int.midasplayer.com/job/defold-qrt/) to a build job that can do this for you. It uploads to [MBDL/DefoldQRT](https://mbdl3.midasplayer.com/#/builds/DefoldQRT)

You can also download desktop and html5 versions from the artifacts on that page.

### Defold Team
The following smoke tests are currently performed by the team on each platform (OSX, Win, Linux):
* Start editor, build BBS for desktop and HTML5

        $ git checkout master
        $ git pull
        $ git merge beta

 1. Push master!

        $ git push

    This will trigger a build of the engines and editors for stable.
    
 1. Wait for the editor build: [sign-editor-master](http://ci.defold.com/builders/sign-editor-master).

    Make a note of the release sha1. Either via the build page, or latest commit to the master branch on github
 
 1. Fetch editor via:
 
    http://d.defold.com/editor2/`STABLE-SHA1`/editor2/Defold-x86_64-darwin.dmg
    http://d.defold.com/editor2/`STABLE-SHA1`/editor2/Defold-x86_64-win32.zip
    http://d.defold.com/editor2/`STABLE-SHA1`/editor2/Defold-x86_64-linux.zip
