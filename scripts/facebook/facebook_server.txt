1. The method ServerHandler#do_GET in facebook_generic_server.py is responsible
for GET requests. The function can be modified for specific development needs,
but defaults to printing a dictionary of every GET variable that is received.

2. Start the server by executing facebook_server.sh. The first parameter to the
script has to be the port. Example /bin/bash facebook_server.sh 8080 (if you
want to execute another server such as facebook_iap_server.py you have to edit
the facebook_server.sh script.)

3. Visit http://fbdev.midasplayer.com/setup and setup a new route to your
machine. The IP can be retrieved via `ifconfig` on OS X, `ipconfig` on Windows
and `ip addr` or `ifconfig` on Linux. IP addresses on King's internal network
starts with 172 (172.19.13.173 for example).
    - Select HTTPS as protocol
    - Enter <ipv4-addr>:<port> in the text field (172.19.13.173:8080)
    - Submit and write down the external URL that is returned
    - The local machine is now reachable through the external URL over HTTPS.
    - fbdev.midasplayer.com is only reachable through the cable network!
