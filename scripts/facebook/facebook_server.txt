1. The method ServerHandler#do_GET in facebook_generic_server.py is responsible
for GET requests. The function can be modified for specific development needs,
but defaults to printing a dictionary of every GET variable that is received.

2. Start the server by executing facebook_server.sh. The first parameter to the
script has to be the port. Example /bin/bash facebook_server.sh 8080 (if you
want to execute another server such as facebook_iap_server.py you have to edit
the facebook_server.sh script.)

3. Visit http://fbdev.midasplayer.com/setup and setup a new route to your
machine. The IP can be retrieved via `ifconfig` on OS X, `ipconfig` on Windows
and `ip addr` or `ifconfig` on Linux. IP addresses on King's internal network
starts with 172 (172.19.13.173 for example).
    - Select HTTPS as protocol
    - Enter <ipv4-addr>:<port> in the text field (172.19.13.173:8080)
    - Submit and write down the external URL that is returned
    - The local machine is now reachable through the external URL over HTTPS.
    - fbdev.midasplayer.com is only reachable through the cable network!


NOTE 1: If you wish to use the editor at the same time, choose another port than 8080

NOTE 2: If you are using the DefoldIAPtester app, you need to update the app with the new server address.
(Search for *.fbdev.midasplayer.com). You'll find it in store.gui_script and also the products (.html).
On the FB app page, you need to change:
* Settings: "Facebook Canvas - Secure Canvas URL"
* Canvas Payments: "Payments Object - Callback URL" (verify with "tokentest") and "Payment Subscriptions Object - Callback URL" (verify with "tokentest")
Lastly, before starting the local server, you need to copy the resources (products html and product images) from the "Defold IAP Tester" app, to your local server folder:
E.g. to ~/work/defold/scripts/facebook/DefoldAPItester/...
